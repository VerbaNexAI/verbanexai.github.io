  journal      = {Proc. of SemEval},
  abstract     = {Nowadays, persuasive messages are more and more frequent in social networks, which generates great concern in several communities, given that persuasion seeks to guide others towards the adoption of ideas, attitudes or actions that they consider to be beneficial to themselves. The efficient detection of news genre categories, detection of framing and detection of persuasion techniques requires several scientific disciplines, such as computational linguistics and sociology. Here we illustrate how we use lexical features given a news article, determine whether it is an opinion piece, aims to report factual news, or is satire. This paper presents a novel strategy for news based on Lexical Weirdness. The results are part of our participation in subtasks 1 and 2 in SemEval 2023 Task 3.},

  abstract     = {Depression is a prevalent mental disorder characterized by persistent sadness, lack of interest, and diminished pleasure. Detecting depression is crucial for timely intervention and support. In this paper, we address the task of depression detection in text data, focusing on binary classification and regression. We present our approach, leveraging a dataset comprising labeled messages from Telegram groups related to mental disorders. We begin by exploring the existing literature on depression detection, highlighting the challenges faced and the methods employed. Our approach involves data pre-processing, lexical feature extraction, phonesthemes embedding, and using the RoBERTa transformer model. We achieved promising results in the training phase through rigorous experimentation and model refinement. However, we encountered challenges upon evaluating our approach in the MentalRiskEs evaluation. We identified areas for improvement, particularly in latency and speed of detection for real-time monitoring of depression-related risks. This research contributes to the ongoing efforts in automating depression detection and provides insights into the potential of text analysis techniques for mental health assessment. We remain committed to further enhancing our methodology and advancing the field to improve the well-being of individuals affected by depression, emphasizing the importance of early detection systems that are not only accurate but also responsive. Future work will explore multimodal inputs, real-time deployment strategies, and cross-linguistic generalization to increase the applicability and robustness of our system in diverse social and linguistic contexts.},

  journal      = {IEEE Latin America Transactions},
  abstract     = {The adoption of photovoltaic (PV) systems has increased significantly in recent years, driven by the demand for off-grid and on-grid residential and commercial applications. However, the high initial investment required for PV installations has limited their widespread adoption. Governments and marketing enterprises have implemented different strategies to promote PV systems to overcome this barrier, focusing on the return on investment (ROI) concept. However, the conventional approach uses limited economic factors to calculate the ROI. It fails to consider the impact of external factors, such as system degradation, which can vary between systems. To address this issue, we propose a new methodology to estimate the ROI of a photovoltaic system with greater accuracy. Our approach incorporates system-predicted degradation, calculated using historical meteorological data and prediction techniques. We applied this methodology to a photovoltaic system installed at the Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar (UTB) in Cartagena and evaluated it against five different approaches. The results show that our proposed method offers a more accurate and reliable estimation of the ROI of a photovoltaic system, considering a broader range of factors. Overall, our work contributes to advancing the understanding of photovoltaic system ROI calculation and promotes using sustainable energy sources. By providing a more precise estimation of the ROI of a photovoltaic system, our methodology can help potential investors make more informed decisions and promote the adoption of clean energy},

Unfortunately, this ease of connectivity has also led to the misuse of freedom, with many social media users expressing inappropriate and often sexist comments. In response, the field of natural language processing has actively sought solutions to detect and counteract such content. Our study builds upon our previous work presented during the SemEval 2023 competition. Initial results, achieved using only lexical features, prompted a thorough reevaluation. Recognizing the potential of advanced techniques, we embarked on a comprehensive exploration to enhance our approach. Leveraging our experience, we focused on a feature union strategy. By seamlessly combining the ’twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest’ transformer model with established lexical features, we developed a refined methodology that transcends the limitations of individual elements. This approach improved performance and demonstrated the synergistic potential of merging these distinct features. Our improved method revealed significant enhancements, underscoring the effectiveness of our methodology in boosting detection capabilities. It led to a notable improvement of approximately 20% in binary classification accuracy, a substantial leap from our previous results. The strategic blend of linguistic and transformer-based features emerged as the driving force behind this significant advancement.},

Feature extraction was performed using TF-IDF vectorization, transformer fine-tuning, combined feature extraction from TF-IDF and transformers, and a hashtag-specific feature extraction. Regularization techniques such as class balancing and k-fold cross-validation were applied to ensure robust model performance. Various classifiers, including Random Forest, Support Vector Classifier, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression, were evaluated to determine the most effective models.

The Xception model showed the best performance with an accuracy of 93.45% and a loss of 0.4842, surpassing the other models. Image preprocessing and transfer learning were key to achieving these results. Despite the good results, challenges were identified in accurately classifying some images, suggesting areas for future improvement.
