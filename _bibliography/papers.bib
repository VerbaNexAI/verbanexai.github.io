   abstract = {Nowadays, persuasive messages are increasingly frequent in social networks, which generates particular concern in several communities, given that persuasion seeks to guide others towards adopting ideas, attitudes, or actions that they consider to be beneficial to themselves. The efficient detection of news genre categories, detection of framing, and detection of persuasion techniques require several scientific disciplines, such as computational linguistics and sociology. Here we illustrate how we use lexical features given a news article to determine whether it is an opinion piece, aims to report factual news, or is satire. This paper presents a novel strategy for communication based on Lexical Weirdness. The results are part of our participation in Sub-Tasks 1 and 2 in SemEval 2023 Task 3.},

   abstract = {The adoption of photovoltaic (PV) systems has increased significantly in recent years, driven by the demand for off-grid and on-grid residential and commercial applications. However, the high initial investment required for PV installations has limited their widespread adoption. Governments and marketing enterprises have implemented different strategies to promote PV systems to overcome this barrier, focusing on the return on investment (ROI) concept. However, the conventional approach uses limited economic factors to calculate the ROI. It fails to consider the impact of external factors, such as system degradation, which can vary between systems. To address this issue, we propose a new methodology to estimate the ROI of a photovoltaic system with greater accuracy. Our approach incorporates system-predicted degradation, calculated using historical meteorological data and prediction techniques. We applied this methodology to a photovoltaic system installed at the Universidad Tecnologica de Bolivar (UTB) in Cartagena and evaluated it against five different approaches. The results show that our proposed method offers a more accurate and reliable estimation of the ROI of a photovoltaic system, considering a broader range of factors. Overall, our work contributes to advancing the understanding of photovoltaic system ROI calculation and promotes using sustainable energy sources. By providing a more precise estimation of the ROI of a photovoltaic system, our methodology can help potential investors make more informed decisions and promote the adoption of clean energy sources.},

This paper proposes implementing a news verifier web application that uses artificial intelligence techniques to determine the veracity of news provided by users. The system consists of three stages: user input validation, selection of relevant sources, and information analysis. We trained a logistic regression model with an in-house dataset of 2000 sentences for input validation. We utilized cosine similarity and FastText for source selection. Finally, a large language model analyzes the context and coherence of selected articles to determine veracity. The transparent presentation of results fosters media literacy.

   abstract = {Social networks are now integral to modern life, offering instant global communication. Unfortunately, this ease of connectivity has also led to the misuse of freedom, with many social media users expressing inappropriate and often sexist comments. In response, the field of natural language processing has actively sought solutions to detect and counteract such content. Our study builds upon our previous work presented during the SemEval 2023 competition. Initial results, achieved using only lexical features, prompted a thorough reevaluation. Recognizing the potential of advanced techniques, we embarked on a comprehensive exploration to enhance our approach. Leveraging our experience, we focused on a feature union strategy. By seamlessly combining the 'twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest' transformer model with established lexical features, we developed a refined methodology that transcends the limitations of individual elements. This approach improved performance and demonstrated the synergistic potential of merging these distinct features. Our improved method revealed significant enhancements, underscoring the effectiveness of our methodology in boosting detection capabilities. It led to a notable improvement of approximately 20% in binary classification accuracy, a substantial leap from our previous results. The strategic blend of linguistic and transformer-based features emerged as the driving force behind this significant advancement.},

Mutual Information is the most compelling feature selection method, improving prediction accuracy notably. It identifies features such as reserves, month, and Ocean Nino Index in the study. The Random Forest model with Mutual Information-based selection achieved an R2 value of 95%.

Given the importance of agriculture and the challenges crops face due to pests and diseases, a vision-based approach is proposed to improve the early and accurate identification of diseases in cucumbers. Three CNN architectures were evaluated: Xception, VGG16, and ResNet50, using a balanced dataset of images of healthy and diseased cucumber leaves. The Xception model showed the best performance with an accuracy of 93.45% and a loss of 0.4842, surpassing the other models. Image preprocessing and transfer learning were key to achieving these results. Despite the good results, challenges were identified in accurately classifying some images, suggesting areas for future improvement. This system provides a valuable tool for farmers, enabling early detection and rapid decision-making to control diseases, which can significantly improve crop quality and yield. Future research could integrate this system with mobile technologies and drones for more efficient real-time monitoring.},

   abstract = {The decision to pursue a professional career is paramount for young people. Yet, the absence of adequate guidance can result in misguided choices. In Colombia, most high school students need a clearer understanding of their future career aspirations. This lack of clarity often leads to a significant dropout rate at the university level. Furthermore, students entering university tend to consider something other than STEM careers, which could result in a mismatch between their labor skills and future economic needs. To address this issue, we apply machine learning, data mining, and utilizing information from tests such as Saber 11 and the Gardner test, which aim to predict viability within their capabilities oriented toward STEM careers. Applying machine learning models such as XGBoost, Stacking, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and KNN has shown promising results, albeit with challenges in balancing precision and recall for different classes. These advancements represent an opportunity to enhance vocational guidance and increase the likelihood of success and job satisfaction among young people.},
